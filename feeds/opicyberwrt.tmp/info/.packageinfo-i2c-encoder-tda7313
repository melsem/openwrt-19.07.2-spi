Description:  The TDA7313 is a volume, tone (bass and  treble)balance (Left/Right)
 and fader (front/rear) processorfor quality audio applications in car radio and Hi-Fi systems.
 Selectable input gain and external loudness functionare provided.
 Control is accomplished by serial I2Cbus microprocessor interface.
 The AC signal setting is obtained by resistor networksand switches combined with operationalamplifiers.
 Thanks to the used BIPOLAR/CMOS Tecnology,Low Distortion, Low Noise and Low DC stepping areobtained.
