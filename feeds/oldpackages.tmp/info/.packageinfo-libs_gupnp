Title: Library for implementing both UPnP clients and services in C
Maintainer: 
Source: gupnp-0.19.4.tar.xz
Type: ipkg
Description: GUPnP is a library for implementing both UPnP clients and services in C, using
GObject and LibSoup. It allows for fully asynchronous use without using threads
and so cleanly integrates naturally into main-loop based applications, and
supports all of the UPnP features.
